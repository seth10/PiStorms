# PiStorms

The [PiStorms](http://www.mindsensors.com/content/78-pistorms-lego-interface) is a robotics platform. It enables you to create robots using LEGO Mindstorms parts, and control it on a Raspberry Pi with Python. Besides its 4 motor ports, 4 sensor ports, and all the benefits of the Raspberry Pi, the PiStorms lets you do even more. It has a touchscreen for easy visual feedback and touch input. It has a convenient web interface to program and control the device, even accessible on mobile devices.

This document will introduce you to the repository's structure and how the PiStorms functions overall.


## Platform structure and systems

### The Browser
- MSBrowser is the program the end-user will use to launch Python programs on the PiStorms
- Each page displays four items (files and folders). Left and right arrows in the top corner allow for page navigation.
- Tapping a folder will open it, and the leftmost page will have an up arrow to close it and go back
- The hostname appears in cyan at the top, and a battery indicator is shown in the bottom-right
- An red exclamation mark icon will appear in the top-right if there is a new message or update available

### The Web Interface
- Accessing the PiStorms's hostname via a web browser will yield the [PiStorms Web Interface](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/how-to/how-to-access-pistorms-web-interface)
- The dashboard provides basic information including the software and firmware versions, Ethernet and WiFI IP addresses, and current battery voltage. Additionally there are buttons to shutdown or restart the Raspberry Pi, stop or start the browser, and begin touchscreen calibration.
- There is a tab to write and edit programs from your web browser. You can write Python or use the [Blockly](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/pistorms/visual-programming-for-pistorms-robots) visual programming interface here.
- Screenshots can be taken at any time. This page lets you start and stop recording screenshots, as well as download individual screenshots or clear them all.
- A remote control is available, which is particularly useful on a mobile device. There is a joystick to move your robot (using motors B and C). There are also sliders to set the LED colors.
- Log files are also accessible from the web interface


### Blockly
> Blockly is library that adds a visual code editor to web and Android apps. The Blockly editor uses interlocking, graphical blocks to represent code concepts like variables, logical expressions, loops, and more. It allows users to apply programming principles without having to worry about syntax or the intimidation of a blinking cursor on the command line.

On the programs tab of the web interface lets you edit text, or Blockly programs. You can think of Blockly like Scratch, but built with extensibility in mind. There are a set of standard blocks, then we add in blocks for the PiStorms, such as those for reading sensors, moving motors, and drawing on the screen. You can find a blog post introducing the systen [here](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/pistorms/visual-programming-for-pistorms-robots).

#### The toolbox and what-code-goes-where
Diving in to the nitty-gritty, let's look at how we add these blocks. Each block has two components: a definition of how the block should look (input/output, connections, etc.) and how to generate code from that visual block. These are referred to as the *Block Definition* and the *Generator*. In this project we are using JavaScript to define the block and JavaScript to generate the Python code for each block.

The left sidebar of the Blockly editor is called the *toolbox*. This is defined in `www/html/programs.php`, in an <xml> tag with the id="toolbox". To avoid this file being literally thousands of lines long, we use php to include the files in `www/html/blockly/`. Each file in this directory defines a category, and creates the block definition and generator.

First is a <category> tag which defines the category and which blocks it consists of. If you add a block but don't see it in the toolbox, you likely forgot to add an entry to this xml. Also check the spelling of the `type` attribute of your <block> tag, it might not match what you define later. Alternatively, if you see a small black block then it could not find a block definition matching that `type`.

The `name` attribute of the <category> tag is the label that will appear for the user in the toolbox. The `colour` attribute (yes, must have British spelling) defines the color of the small bar to the left of the category label. Note this does not affect the color of the blocks *inside* this category, those are defined individually.

Some further content might be included in the <block> tag to define the default arguments (?). <sep> tags are used to adjust the spacing between blocks. By default there is a gap size of 20 between blocks, so specifying a gap of 5 will pull the blocks closer together, while something larger like 50 will visually separate them into groups.

#### The block definition
Then there is the <script> tag. Here we detail the block definition and generator. The [Blockly Developer Tools](https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/demos/blockfactory/index.html) is a great resource for experimenting with the creation of blocks and learning how the block definition works. If you do use this tool be sure to change the block definition language from JSON to JavaScript and that target language of the generator to Python. You can also save your blocks and a link to each. Please consider clicking "Download Block Library" and commiting that .xml file if you do put a lot of time into that.

There are a few things to consider here. First, the name must match between the `type` attribute of the <block>, the block definition and generator. Avoiding the biggest section (inputs) for the moment, you can specify the connections. If the block returns a value, it should have a "left output" connection. If it is a statement, it should have "top+bottom connections". You can add a tooltip with some hints on the specifics and possible quirks of that block. A help URL may also be set, this should like to the related method in the [PiStorms documentation](www.mindsensors.com/reference/PiStorms/html/index.html). Finally, you can set the color with a value between 0 and 360, that being the hue.

Finally, let's get back to the inputs and fields. There are three types of inputs: value, statement, and dummy. *Value* provides a plug on the right where another block can supply a value. For example, the `terminal_print` block uses this to let the user supply a text value to be printed. You can restrict the type of the value, but for granular control see the numeric input *field*.

A statement input lets the user specify a set of statements. For instance, you see this type of input in the standard "if do" and "repeat while" blocks. A specific example might be the `system_untilkeypress`, which lets the user define what code that want to be repeated until the GO button is pressed. As Python does not support multi-line anonymous functions, you will probably want to use `Blockly.Python.FUNCTION_NAME_PLACEHOLDER_.slice(1,-1)` somewhere in the generator to get a random function name (using `slice` because it's a string surrounded by braces you want to remove to make it a legal identifier).

Lastly, the *dummy input* has neither a value or statement input area, it simply wraps field. You'll see this often, so what are these fields you can put in a dummy (or value/statement) input? The most basic is a text field. It simply acts as a label. You can provide a text input, a numeric input where you can define bounds and precision, even an angle input. You can add a checkbox, colour picker, or allow the user to select a variable to use. Perhaps most useful here is the dropdown field, oft used to let the user pick from a set list of ports. You can also add a small image which might help spice up the text but will more likely look out-of-place.

Note you can't plug in blocks to fields! This might limit some blocks usefulness. They are like text *fields*, where the user can input a value, but not programmatically.

Finally you can force the block to have internal or external inputs. External will force value inputs to appear as a notch on the outer right side of the block. Internal forces them to be encapuslated inside the block. This is merely an aesthetic option, and Blockly will try to pick the best one if you don't specify one or the other.

In addition to the built-in types; String, Boolean and such; you can use "other" to check for a custom type. For instance, `servo_setSpeed` has a value input for which servo, and it only allows the RCServo type to be connected (no Numbers, etc., you must connect an RCServo to that value input). The value can be defined from a block with a left connection. With `.setOutput` you can specify what type this block will return. For instance, `servo_init` has a `this.setOutput(true, "RCServo");`.

#### The [code] generator
Now you must take the block and generate Python code from it. You'll use methods like `block.getFieldValue` for fields and `Blockly.Python.valueToCode` to get the code of a block connected to a value input.

Quite likely there will be some code you want to only include once. For instance, the blocks in `www/html/blockly/grove.php` need the line `import GroveDevices`, but this line doesn't need to appear every time any of these blocks are used. To answer this need Blockly gives us *definitions*. You assign a property of `Blockly.Python.definitions_` to a string. For instance, the line `Blockly.Python.definitions_.import_GroveDevices = "import GroveDevices";` appears in many of those blocks. When Blockly needs to generate the code for a block, it will check if `import_GroveDevices` is already assigned. If not, it will insert the code `import GroveDevices`, but if it is it will skip it.

Besides imports, this can also be used for reusing instances. For instance, a user might have multiple `servo_setPos` blocks in their code, each with a `servo_init` block to specify which servo to use. We don't want to make a new instance of the RCServo class every time it occurs. Instead, we use definitions to make sure an instance is created, but only one for each port. For this we use bracket notation to define this definition dynamically. This is because we don't know which port the user will pick so we can't use, for instance, `Blockly.Python.definitions_.servo_BBS1 = "servo_BBS1 = RCServo('BBS1')";`. This *will* create an instance with the identifier `servo_BBS1` which will be reused, but it assumes bank B servo 1 is selected. I use template literals to dynamically use the port name for the name of the instance.

Blocks with top+bottom connection should have a newline at the end of the returned string. Blocks with a left connection should not, the returned code string should simply evaluate to a value. By default some blocks will use `Blockly.Python.ORDER_NONE`. This leads to many extraneous parenthesis. There is a whole [article](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/operator-precedence) on operator precedence, but using `Blockly.Python.ORDER_ATOMIC` instead works and reduces the number of parenthesis, making the code human-readable.

#### Other remarks
Looking back to `www/html/programs.php`, shortly after the xml toolbox definition there's a short script. This `GET`s the `isgrx` endpoint from MSWeb (see [services](https://github.com/mindsensors/PiStorms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#services)). Note the toolbox includes both the GRX and standard PiStorms categories. The script removes the categories which are not pertinent to the current device. Note to avoid duplicate category names, the GRX equivalents are postponed with a `_GRX`, which is then removed after that category for the standard PiStorms is removes.

A better way to do this might be to include only the standard PiStorms categories and possibly replace them when the page loads. This would happen before the user is able to open a Blockly program, so they wouldn't notice. However, to keep things consistent (all content in the `www/html/blockly` directory loaded when the page is generated through PHP), this approach was avoided. JavaScript would have to be able to request the GRX categories to include via MSWeb.

As each file in `www/html/blockly` is directly included, the <script> tags will also appear inside of the xml tag. Perhaps this shouldn't be the case, but it works and is much cleaner to have the block definitions and generators in the same file as the related xml.

A helper function `makeBlock` was tested in `www/html/blockly/servos.php`. This was added in an attempt to make the block definitions and generators easier to read. I believe it succeeds in this and should be considered for use in the other `www/html/blockly` files.


### Services
A couple system services are set up for specific PiStorms operations. These script files are copied from `setup` to `/etc/init.d/` when `setup/setup.sh` is run, in addition to making them execute at startup with the proper priority.

#### MSDriver.sh
This is responsible for running `programs/utils/get-device-type.py` to boot to update the device field of `/etc/local/mindsensors/conf/msdev.cfg` checking for a help GO button to shutdown, and showing the mindsensors.com logo whlie the Pi shuts down. The device field of `/etc/local/mindsensors/conf/msdev.cfg` is used in many places to run code differing between the PiStorms and PiStorms-GRX. These include MSBrowser and MSWeb, so MSDriver has a higher priority so it can run and update the config file first.

The `goPressCount` register holds the number of times the GO button has been pressed. This maxes out at 250, at which point additional key presses will not alter this value until it is set to 0. Alternatively, when the GO button is held for ten seconds this register will read 253. `MSDriver.py` is responsible for checking if this register reads 253, and running a shutdown command when it does.

The `lckfile` nonsense was intended to have this work on a system which uses a different service manager than `systemd`. This would work in conjunction with `sys/psm_shutdown`.

#### MSBrowser.sh
This is responsible for running the browser program. This is what prints the message "Loading PiStorms" "Please wait". It also updates `/var/tmp/.hw_version` (used in `sys/ps_updater.py` and `programs/utils/hardware_update.py`). It starts the browser and redirects its output to `var/tmp/psmb.out` (read by MSWeb). It also runs `ps_messenger_check.py` and `ps_updater.py` once (to check for updates(?)). Finally, it runs `pistorms-diag.sh` for record diagnostics information, and writes it to `/boot`. If a user contacts mindsensors.com support, we might ask for this file. Having it on the boot partition means they can pop the microSD card in their computer and copy the file off, no `scp` needed.

#### MSWeb.sh
Simple enough, this runs `www/web_api/MSWeb.py`. Note this is different than the Apache server, this just helps when the web interface needs to get information from the system. MSWeb.py uses Flask to host various endpoints. For instance, `GET`ting `/firmware` will return the current firmware version. Similar for `/device`, `/battery`, etc. Some endpoints like `/shutdown` will run a command, `psm_shutdown` in this case.


### Executables
- **psm_shutdown**: Runs some mess with `/tmp/.psm_shutdown.lck` before passing its arguments onto `/sbin/shutdown`.
- **swarmserver**: The binary used to orchestrate the swarm demo.

## Repository files

### setup
#### Suggestions
- When developing, run setup/enableHardlinks.sh to hard link the source files from `/home/pi/PiStorms/...` to their intended locations in the file system (where `setup.h` copies them). This will avoid, for instance, modifying `sys/MSBrowser.sh`, but forgetting to copy it to `/usr/local/bin/MSBrowser.sh` and wondering why your edits don't seem to be changing anything (still, don't forget to run `sudo /etc/init.d/MSBrowser.sh restart`!).

### sys
- **GroveDevices.py**: Implementations on Grove sensors (and actuators), inherit from the GrovePort class in the PiStorms_GRX module
- **LegoDevices.py**: Basic NXT and EV3 sensors
- **MSBrowser.py**: The [browser program](https://github.com/mindsensors/PiStorms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-browser)
- **MSDriver.py**: Shuts down the Raspberry Pi after GO is held for 5 seconds
- **MS_ILI9341.py**: Inherits from `Adafruit_ILI9341` and adds screenshot support
- **MsDevices.py**: Implementations of mindsensors sensors
- **PiStorms.py**: The wrapper class users instantiate and use. It mainly aligns one-to-one with PiStormsCom functions.
- **PiStorms_GRX.py**: This module implements the GrovePort, RCServo, RCServoEncoder, and PiStorms_GRX classes.
  - *GrovePort*: This "abstract" class represents a generic Grove sensor. You can provide a port and type to the __init__ method. It will check that these arugments are valid, then this object will have a `.readValue` or `.writeValue` method. That's it. The classes in GroveDevices inherit from this class.
  - *RCServo*: This class models an RC servo connected to one of the GRX's six servo ports. It supports accounting for the neutral point, which will be loaded from msdev.cfg if these configuration values exist.
  - *RCServoEncoder*: This is a subclass of the previous two classes. It models a servo with an associated encoder, which may be used to set a target position.
  - *PiStorms_GRX*: This understandably represents the PiStorms-GRX. Its' methods are modeled after those of the PiStorms class, but most all of them are class methods because there's no reason to need an instance of PiStorms_GRX.
- **PiStormsCom.py**: Handles primary I2C communications
- **PiStormsCom_GRX.py**: This module contains the GRXCom class, the communications class for the PiStorms-GRX. It has two instances of mindsensors_i2c, one for each bank. It has constants for beginning port addresses, offsets, port modes, other registers, and commands. Some methods are built for compatibility with PiStormsCom. These are all class methods as they have no reason to require an instance. However, you can provide an instance of mindsensor_i2c (one of GRXCom.I2C) and address (from GRXCom.SERVO, GRXCom.ANALOG, or GRXCom.DIGITAL) to create an instance of GRXCom. This provides utility methods like setType and analogRead.
- **TouchScreenInput.py**: A convenience module to get text input using a touchscreen keyboard
- **mindsensors.py**: Implementations of more mindsensors sensors
- **mindsensorsUI.py**: Represents the screen, providing useful graphics functions
- **msdev.cfg**: Configurations including the device type, default screen rotation, home folder, and from what URLs messages and updates are found
- **pistorms-diag.sh**: Diagnostics are written to psm-diag.txt on the boot partition
- **ps_messenger_check.py**: Checks the [message server](http://pistorms.mindsensors.com/messenger.php) and keeps `/var/tmp/ps_data.json` up-to-date
- **ps_updater.py**: Checks the [update server](http://pistorms.mindsensors.com/versions.php) (while sending analytics) to keep `/var/tmp/ps_versions.json` up-to-date
- **psm_shutdown**: Wraps the OS shutdown command, but also writes to `/tmp/.psm_shutdown.lck`
- **rmap.py**: Used for [Scratch](https://github.com/mindsensors/PiStorms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#scratch) integration
- **rmapcfg.py**: IP and port to use for Scratch integration
- **scratch.py**: Methods for sending messages with Scratch
- **swarmclient.py**: Examples of communicating between multiple PiStorms
- **swarmserver**: Binary used for inter-PiStorms communication

- **00-WiFi_Setup.py**: Used to connect to the internet directly from the PiStorms. It displays a list of scanned WiFi networks and will let you enter a passphrase using an on-screen keyboard.
- **03-Swarm_Demo.py**: Displays a smiley face on screen. You can drag it with the stylus and it will move on the screen of all swarm neighbors as well.
- **09-refresh.py**: If anything changes in the programs folder, they will not be reflected in the browser until it is refreshed. Another way to achieve this is to enter and exit any folder. A program might have been created or renamed from the web interface (or an SSH session).
- **09-shutdown.py**: Let's you shutdown the PiStorms from the device itself. It will display a confirmation before shutting down. Note there is also a shutdown (and restart) button on the PiStorms Web Interface dashboard. Also note holding the GO button for five seconds will restart the PiStorms.
- **10-ico**: These are files from the image recognition robot [blog post](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/pistorms/image-recognition-robot-with-pistorms-and-pi-camera)
- **20-BlocklyDemos**: Examples using the [Blockly](https://github.com/mindsensors/PiStorms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#the-web-interface) visual programming interface.

- **utils**: Various system utility programs. This folder is not visible in the browser as it is not preceded by two digits.
- **addresschange**: A binary used by `45-Utils/09-Change_i2c_addr.py` to change the PiStorms's I2C address
- **touch_sensor_tutorial.py**: The program written in the [PiStorms Python Programming Tutorial](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/how-to/pistorms-python-programming-tutorial)

### README.md
- Instructions for an end-user to download and setup this project

### CONTRIBUTING.md
- An overview of this repository and explanation of the structure of this project

## Details
Lets walk through what setup.sh does from start to finish, and what happens at boot time. We will also cover every relevant directory on the system.

`MSDriver.sh`, `MSBrowser.sh`, and `MSWeb.sh` will run at boot time. MSDriver handles shutting down the system when GO is held.

The PiStorms has firmware which controls the motor and sensor ports, and which gets input from the touch part of the touchscreen. The Raspberry Pi sends commands over I2C to the PiStorms to tell it what to do. The screen itself communicates via SPI. This means that the screen might work, but you won't be able to tap anything because you can't get touchscreen values from the PiStorms if I2C is broken. The opposite is, therefore, true, too. The screen will not work if SPI is broken, but you could still move motors, etc. if I2C is still functioning.


## Relevant filesystem locations
- **/home/pi/PiStorms**: The home folder
- **/usr/local/mindsensors/images**: Images used in MSBrowser.py, by MS_ILI9341.py for framing screenshots, and one the directories searched for relative filename arguments to `fillBmp` in mindsensorsUI
- **/usr/local/mindsensors/conf**: Contains only `msdev.cfg`, used for keeping track of the device type (PiStorms or PiStorms-GRX), screen rotation, homefolder (most likely `/home/pi/PiStorms`), and notification and update servers
- **/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages**: Where most of the `.py` files are copied from `sys` to. Python looks here when you attempt to import a module. See [suggestions](https://github.com/mindsensors/PiStorms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#suggestions)
- **/etc/init.d**: Where `.sh` scripts from `setup` are placed to run at startup as services
- **/usr/local/bin/**: Where `MSBrowser.py`, `MSDriver.py`, `pistorms-diag.sh`, `ps_messenger_check.py`, `psm_shutdown`, `ps_updater.py`, and `swarmserver` reside
- **/var/tmp**: Where `ps_data.json`, `ps_images` (directory), `ps_m`, `psmb.out`, `psm-diag.txt`, `psmd.out`, `ps_u`, `ps_versions.json`, `sws.out`, and `webapi.out` are
- **/boot**: Where `psm-diag.txt` is copied for ease of access
- **/home/pi/PiStorms/programs/utils**: Various programs used from MS services


## Design improvement suggestions
- There are a number of things I would like to better organize or clean up, but most would be difficult due to the requirement of supporting previous systems. Backwards compatibility is the issue.
- For example, the images MSBrowser relies on should not be cluttering up the general programs folder.
- `rmap.py` should be renamed to make its purpose (Scratch) more clear.
- `MsDevices.py` and `mindsensors.py` should be merged.
- The log files should have more meaningful names and be put in `/var/log`, not `/tmp`. Further, `.psm_shutdown.lck` should be in `/var/lock`, not `/tmp`. Note `/var/lock` *is* on a temporary file system, so a reboot will remove any stale locks.
- `MSBrowser.py`, `MSDriver.py`, `ps_messenger_check.py`, and `ps_updater.py` should not be in `/usr/local/bin` because they are not executable *binaries*.
